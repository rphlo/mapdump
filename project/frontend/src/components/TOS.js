        Don’t misuse our Services. For example, don’t interfere with our
        Services or try to access them using a method other than the interface
        and the instructions that we provide. You may use our Services only as
        permitted by law, including applicable export and re-export control laws

        suspected misconduct.

      <p>
        Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual
        property rights in our Services or the content you access. You may not
        use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its
        owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These terms do not grant you
        the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Don’t

        our Services.

        Our Services display some content that is not Mapdump.com’s. This
        content is the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it
        available. We may review content to determine whether it is illegal or
        violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content
        that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But that
        does not necessarily mean that we review content, so please don’t assume
        that we do.
      </p>
      <p>
        In connection with your use of the Services, we may send you service
        announcements, administrative messages, and other information. You may
